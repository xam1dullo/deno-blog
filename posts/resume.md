## WorkExperience

### Teclardev,remote Fev.2022–Apr 2023 SoftwareEngineer

-   By implementing an independent microservice with a web socket, the response time of the leading service has been reduced by up to 3x
-   Optimized memory usage of a service by 90% by identifying and fixing memory leaks.
-   Enhanced the quality of the core features of the application by writing unit tests of various complexity.
-   Optimized microservice using Nodejs and Typescript as interfaces to MongoDB NoSQL database.
-   By improving caching, we have significantly accelerated the communication time of the service.
-   This will improve the user experience and make the service more responsive.
-   Automated code review and check quality process using litres, and testing tools like Jest.
-   I used Playwright to collect automated data from the website.
-   Technologies used: Nodejs, Deno, Typescript, Websocket, Jest, mocha, Playwright, Redis, Golang

### Teclardev,remote Oct. 2021 –Fev. 2022 SoftwareEngineeringIntern

-   We first used Ajv to validate the data schema. This ensured that the data was in a valid format and that it could be successfully filtered.
-   I used Playwright to add a login form to the website. The login form required a username and password. Once we submitted the login form, we were able to get the cookies for the website.
-   Technologies: Nodejs, Javascript, Ajv, Mocha, Chai, Playwright, Puppeteer

## Strengths

### Life-longLearner

-   Never done learning and always seeking to improve myself. Curious about new possibilities and taking action to explore them.

## VolunteerExperience

-   I mentored 5 university students in Javascript Nodejs. I started by providing them with a basic overview of the technologies. I then helped them to build a simple web application using Javascript and Nodejs. I provided them with feedback on their code and helped them to troubleshoot any problems that they encountered
